## About

The goal of an airport controller is to guide air traffic, prevent airplanes from overlapping or colliding, and ensure they take off and land safely at the airport.

This project consists of a comprehensive airport traffic control simulation system with the following components:

- **Node.js Server**: Handles all communication and coordination between different components
- **Chromium Client**: A browser-based interface using plain JavaScript and HTML to display real-time airplane animations across multiple screens
- **Flutter Controller App**: A mobile application that serves as the primary control interface, providing:
  - Start, stop, pause, and restart functionality for both simulation and server
  - Text-to-speech feature that announces airplane commands
  - Customizable voice settings for enhanced user experience
  - Real-time control of aircraft movements and airport operations

The system is designed to work seamlessly with Liquid Galaxy (LG) rigs, providing an immersive multi-screen experience for air traffic control simulation.

## Requirements

### Server Requirements
- **Node.js Version**: 4.2.6 (default version available in LG systems)
- Compatible with Liquid Galaxy infrastructure

### Mobile App Requirements
- **Android Version**: 13+ (maximum supported version)
- Flutter-compatible device

## Server Setup

1. **Download and Extract**
   - Download the project ZIP file
   - Extract it to your home directory
   - Keep the default Git repository name for the folder

2. **Initial Setup**
   - Navigate to the extracted folder
   - Ensure Node.js 4.2.6 is installed and accessible

## Mobile Connection

### Step 1: Read Instructions
- Open the mobile app
- You will see an instruction page upon first launch
- **Important**: Read the instructions carefully as they contain important rules and operational information

### Step 2: Connect to LG
- Navigate to the **Settings** section in the app
- Connect to the Liquid Galaxy rig first
- Wait for successful connection confirmation

### Step 3: Start Server
- After successful LG connection, go to **Settings** â†’ **Game Task**
- Start the server from this section
- **Note**: Server startup may take some time
- Wait patiently as the system will automatically open Chromium on all screens of the rig

### Step 4: Begin Simulation
- Once all screens are connected and displaying properly, start the game
- The simulation will begin with planes automatically departing from other airports
- **Your Tasks**:
  - Manage incoming aircraft safely
  - Handle plane takeoffs in the directions specified in the right tab on the home screen
  - Available planes for takeoff will be displayed in the designated area

## Functionalities

### Game Controls
- **Pause**: Temporarily halt the simulation
- **Resume**: Continue paused simulation
- **Start**: Begin new simulation session
- **Stop**: End current simulation

### Server Controls
- **Start**: Initialize the communication server
- **Stop**: Shut down the server safely

### Additional Features
- Real-time aircraft tracking and management
- Multi-screen display support for Liquid Galaxy
- Voice announcements with customizable settings
- Interactive control interface optimized for mobile devices

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Socket.IO for real-time communication
- **Frontend**: Plain JavaScript and HTML for browser-based visualization
- **Mobile App**: Flutter framework for cross-platform compatibility
- **Communication**: WebSocket connections via Socket.IO for real-time data exchange
